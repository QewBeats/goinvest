## Introduction
Savings havent been adopted in quickly in Ghana as hoped for.People aren't as comfortable with the banking systems, and they tend to be an inconvenience for them.
Mobile usage and its activity are on an increasing trajectory though.The average Ghanaian spends money topping up credit to communicate more than he'd commit that same amount to savings. This project aims to use peoples already establish habits with mobile phone usage, to encourage them to save. By allowing users to dedicate a percentage of their airtime credit they want to send to a "mobile credit savings account",with every top up they make, they unconsciously save some money irrespective of how small the amount, into some savings account.To later cash out.
